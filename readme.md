# italiano-bot

> Andrew Coe is now a Discord Bot

## Usage

This is a super simple Discord bot that I wrote for a 
piss take of a mate. It uses `discord.js`, TypeScript and nothing else
(for now). You can host it and culturally appropriate it
yourself, don't forget to add a token.

He is currently activated by typing `Italiano` into Discord

## Setup

This requires the following for compilation:

- `node`
- `npm`
- `tsc`

Just run the commands
```
npm install
tsc index.ts
node index.js
```
and you should be good to go.
